### Onboarding Screens Implementation (2026-03-12)
**Files Created:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Auth/OnboardingView.swift`

**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/RootView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

**Feature Added:**
Implemented 3-page swipeable onboarding flow shown before login on first app launch using the existing TabView paging pattern and PageIndicator component.

**Implementation:**
1. **OnboardingView Structure:**
   - 3 swipeable pages using `TabView` with `.tabViewStyle(.page(indexDisplayMode: .never))`
   - Reused existing `PageIndicator` component for dots + labels
   - Each page: large SF Symbol icon (72pt), headline (`.title .bold`), body text (`.body .pfTextSecondary`)
   - Page 1: "Monitor Your Farm" — `cube.fill` icon
   - Page 2: "Smart Job Queue" — `tray.full.fill` icon  
   - Page 3: "Stay Informed" — `bell.badge.fill` icon + "Get Started" button
   - "Skip" button in top-right corner on all pages

2. **First-Launch State Tracking:**
   - Added `@AppStorage("hasSeenOnboarding")` boolean in RootView
   - Defaults to `false` (show onboarding)
   - Set to `true` when user taps "Get Started" or "Skip"
   - Persists across app restarts via UserDefaults

3. **RootView Integration:**
   - Added onboarding check: `else if !hasSeenOnboarding { OnboardingView(hasSeenOnboarding: $hasSeenOnboarding) }`
   - Flow: launch screen → onboarding (if `!hasSeenOnboarding` + `hasCheckedAuth` + `!isAuthenticated`) → login → main app
   - Onboarding shown before login, after auth check completes

**Key Patterns:**
- TabView paging pattern consistent with DashboardView, JobListView, MaintenanceView
- PageIndicator component reused (no new UI components needed)
- @AppStorage for simple boolean persistence (UserDefaults wrapper)
- Binding passed to child view to update parent state: `OnboardingView(hasSeenOnboarding: $hasSeenOnboarding)`

**Design Consistency:**
- Icons: 72pt, `.pfAccent` color
- Headlines: `.title .bold`
- Body text: `.body`, `.pfTextSecondary`, centered, 32pt horizontal padding
- "Get Started" button: `.borderedProminent`, `.tint(.pfAccent)`
- "Skip" button: `.plain` style, `.pfTextSecondary`, top-right placement
- Layout: centered VStack with `Spacer()` for vertical centering

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### SignalR Real-Time Updates for Dashboard (2026-03-12)
**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift`

**Bug Fixed:**
Printer cards in the Dashboard and Printer List were showing stale state after print completion, while the Printer Detail page showed accurate real-time state.

**Root Cause:**
- `PrinterDetailViewModel` ✅ subscribed to SignalR updates via `configureSignalR()`
- `PrinterListViewModel` ✅ subscribed to SignalR updates via `configureSignalR()`
- `DashboardViewModel` ❌ did NOT subscribe to SignalR updates — only loaded data on initial load/refresh

**Solution:**
Added SignalR subscription to `DashboardViewModel` following the same pattern used in `PrinterListViewModel`:

1. **DashboardViewModel Changes:**
   - Added `signalRService` property
   - Created `configureSignalR()` method to subscribe to printer updates
   - Created `applyPrinterUpdate()` method to update printer state in the printers array
   - Updates all printer fields: state, progress, job name, temps, targets, spool info

2. **DashboardView Changes:**
   - Added `viewModel.configureSignalR(services.signalRService)` call in `.task` block
   - Now receives real-time updates alongside initial data load

**Key Pattern:**
All ViewModels that display printer data (list, detail, dashboard) now consistently subscribe to SignalR's `onPrinterUpdated` handler and apply updates to their local printer state. This ensures all views stay in sync with real-time printer status changes.

**Architecture Note:**
SignalRService uses a broadcast pattern — all subscribed ViewModels receive all printer updates. Each ViewModel filters updates by printer ID if needed (e.g., PrinterDetailViewModel only processes updates for its printer, while PrinterListViewModel and DashboardViewModel process all updates).

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### Farm Status Integration into Dashboard (2025-01-20)
**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Extensions/Formatting+Extensions.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Jobs/JobListView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Navigation/AppDestination.swift`

**Files Deleted:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Jobs/JobAnalyticsView.swift`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Integrated Farm Status Sections into Dashboard:**
   - Added Queue Health card showing queued/printing/paused counts + average wait time
   - Added "By Printer Model" breakdown with job counts per model
   - Added "Active Print ETAs" showing currently printing jobs with progress
   - Added "Up Next" showing next 5 queued jobs with assigned printers and queue position
   - All sections use existing JobAnalyticsService methods

2. **Updated DashboardViewModel:**
   - Added `queueStats`, `modelStats`, and `upcomingJobs` properties
   - Added `jobAnalyticsService` dependency injection
   - Extended `loadDashboard()` to fetch farm status data alongside printers/queue
   - Added `activePrintingPrinters` computed property

3. **Layout Strategy:**
   - iPad: 2-column layout for Model Breakdown + Active ETAs side-by-side
   - iPhone: stacked vertical layout
   - Farm Status sections placed after Active Jobs, before Dispatch link (iPhone) or alongside Dispatch (iPad)
   - Consistent card styling with `.pfCard`, `.pfBorder`, rounded corners

4. **Added TimeInterval Extension:**
   - Created `etaFormatted` in `Formatting+Extensions.swift`
   - Shows "2:45 PM" for today, "Tomorrow 10:00 AM" for tomorrow, relative format for further dates
   - Complements existing `durationFormatted` for elapsed time

5. **Removed Job Analytics Page:**
   - Deleted `JobAnalyticsView.swift` (functionality now on Dashboard)
   - Removed `case jobAnalytics` from `AppDestination.swift`
   - Removed toolbar button from `JobListView.swift` (lines 39-43)
   - Removed navigation case from `destinationView` (lines 319-320)
   - Updated Xcode project.pbxproj to remove file references

**Key Patterns:**
- Used separate helper functions (`modelStatRow`, `activePrintRow`, `upNextRow`) to break up complex VStack expressions for faster type-checking
- ForEach with `Array()` wrapper and explicit `id:` for non-Binding collections
- Color references use `Color.pfAccent` instead of `.pfAccent` in `.foregroundStyle()` to avoid ShapeStyle type inference issues
- Responsive design: 4-column grid on iPad, 2-column on iPhone for queue stats

**Architecture Decisions:**
- DashboardViewModel now aggregates both fleet status and job analytics data
- JobAnalyticsViewModel kept intact (reusable for future analytics features)
- Farm Status is now the dashboard's primary view of queue health, not a separate navigation destination

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### Temperature Display Enhancements (2025-01-20)
**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Components/PrinterCardView.swift` (iPhone)
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Components/iPadPrinterCardView.swift` (iPad)

**Changes Made:**
1. **Dynamic Temperature Format:**
   - Created `temperatureText(current:target:)` function to display "current → target" when heating (target > 0)
   - Shows only "current" when heater off, "---°C" when no data
   - Changed separator from "/" to "→" on iPad to match iPhone
   - Kept `.monospacedDigit()` for consistent text width alignment

2. **Dynamic Icon Colors:**
   - Created `iconColor(for:)` function returning `.pfWarning` (orange) when heater on, `.pfTextTertiary` (gray) when off
   - Applied to both NozzleIcon (hotend) and RadiatorIcon (bed) on both cards
   - Replaced static colors `.pfNotHomed` and `.pfHomed`

3. **Fixed 2-Column Layout:**
   - Added `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)` to each temperature Label
   - Prevents bed icon from shifting when hotend temp text width changes (e.g., "25°C" vs "215°C → 220°C")
   - Both columns now have equal width regardless of content

**Patterns Used:**
- SwiftUI `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment:)` for equal-width columns without Grid complexity
- Conditional rendering based on optional target value: `if let target, target > 0`
- Extracted helper functions for reusable logic (temperatureText, iconColor)
- Maintained consistent font sizing: `.caption` on iPhone, `.subheadline` on iPad

**Key Decisions:**
- Used simple frame-based layout instead of Grid for cleaner code and broad iOS compatibility
- Arrow "→" styled as `.foregroundStyle(.tertiary)` to match the previous "/" styling
- Target temp shown as `.foregroundStyle(.secondary)` to visually distinguish from current temp
- Heater state determined by target value (> 0) rather than adding new model properties

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### Swipeable Paged Layouts for iPhone (2026-03-12)
**Files Created:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Components/PageIndicator.swift`

**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Jobs/JobListView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Maintenance/MaintenanceView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (added PageIndicator, removed JobAnalyticsView)

**Changes Made:**
1. **Created PageIndicator Component:**
   - Reusable view showing dot indicators + page title labels
   - Active dot uses `.pfAccent`, inactive uses `.pfTextTertiary.opacity(0.5)`
   - Labels in `.caption2` with active page highlighted
   - Tapping dots/labels animates to that page
   - 8pt dots, 6pt spacing between dots

2. **DashboardView - 3 Swipeable Pages (iPhone only):**
   - **Page 0 "Overview"**: Fleet Overview summary cards + Queue Health
   - **Page 1 "Active"**: Active Jobs + Active Print ETAs sections
   - **Page 2 "Queue"**: Up Next + By Printer Model + Dispatch link
   - **Pinned content**: Maintenance Alert banner (always visible above TabView when alerts exist)
   - iPad keeps existing 2-column ScrollView layout unchanged
   - Each page has independent `.refreshable` support

3. **JobListView - 3 Swipeable Pages (iPhone only):**
   - **Page 0 "Printing"**: Currently printing/active jobs
   - **Page 1 "Queue"**: Queued/pending jobs with swipe actions (Start, Cancel)
   - **Page 2 "Recent"**: Completed/failed/cancelled jobs (last 10)
   - Each page shows empty state when no jobs in that category
   - iPad keeps existing single-List layout with sections
   - All swipe actions preserved on Queue page

4. **MaintenanceView - 2 Swipeable Pages (iPhone only):**
   - **Page 0 "Alerts"**: Active maintenance alerts + Analytics link + Uptime link
   - **Page 1 "Tasks"**: Upcoming maintenance tasks
   - Empty states for each page when no content
   - iPad keeps existing ScrollView layout
   - Navigation links to MaintenanceAnalytics and UptimeReliability preserved

**Implementation Pattern:**
```swift
if sizeClass == .compact {
    VStack(spacing: 0) {
        TabView(selection: $currentPage) {
            Page1().tag(0)
            Page2().tag(1)
        }
        .tabViewStyle(.page(indexDisplayMode: .never))
        
        PageIndicator(currentPage: $currentPage, pageCount: 2, labels: ["Label1", "Label2"])
    }
} else {
    // iPad: existing layout
}
```

**Key Decisions:**
- Used `.page(indexDisplayMode: .never)` to hide default page dots, replaced with custom PageIndicator
- Each page is an extracted `@ViewBuilder` function for clarity
- Branch on `horizontalSizeClass == .compact` for iPhone, `.regular` for iPad
- Each page content wrapped in ScrollView with independent `.refreshable`
- Empty states shown per-page when appropriate
- 16pt padding on all page content
- Smooth animation on page change (`.easeInOut(duration: 0.25)`)

**Design Adherence:**
- Active page indicator: `.pfAccent` color
- Inactive dots: `.pfTextTertiary.opacity(0.5)`
- Page labels: `.caption2`, `.pfTextSecondary` (inactive), `.pfAccent` (active)
- 8pt dot diameter, 6pt spacing
- 16pt padding on page content
- Dark theme compatible

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### Dispatch Page Navigation Crash Fix (2026-03-12)
**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/ViewModels/DispatchViewModel.swift`

**Bug Fixed:**
App crashed when pressing the back button on the Dispatch Dashboard page (accessed via `AppDestination.dispatchDashboard` from Dashboard).

**Root Cause:**
The `DispatchViewModel` had async methods (`loadQueueStatus()` and `loadHistory()`) that were called from SwiftUI's `.task` and `.refreshable` modifiers. When the user navigated back while these async operations were in progress, the tasks continued execution after the view was dismissed. This caused property updates on the `@Observable` ViewModel during view tear-down, leading to a crash.

**Solution:**
Added `Task.isCancelled` checks in both async methods:
- Check before updating properties after async network calls complete
- Check before updating state properties like `isLoading` and `error`
- Early return if task is cancelled, preventing state mutation during view dismissal

**Pattern Applied:**
```swift
func loadQueueStatus() async {
    // ... async network call
    let status = try await dispatchService.getQueueStatus()
    guard !Task.isCancelled else { return }
    queueStatus = status  // Safe: only update if task not cancelled
}
```

**Key Insight:**
With SwiftUI's `.task` modifier, tasks are automatically cancelled when the view disappears. However, async operations that complete *just as* the view is being dismissed can try to mutate `@Observable` properties during tear-down. Always guard property updates with `Task.isCancelled` checks in async methods called from `.task` or `.refreshable`.

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### App Icon Branding Integration (2026-03-12)
**Assets Created:**
- `PrintFarmer/Assets.xcassets/AppLogo.imageset/` (new image set)
- `PrintFarmer/Assets.xcassets/AppLogo.imageset/AppLogo.png` (1024x1024 PNG)
- `PrintFarmer/Assets.xcassets/AppLogo.imageset/Contents.json`

**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Auth/LoginView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Auth/OnboardingView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/RootView.swift`

**Changes Made:**
Replaced generic SF Symbol placeholder icons (`printer.fill`, `cube.fill`) with the actual PrintFarmer app icon across all pre-authentication screens:

1. **Login Screen (`LoginView.swift`):**
   - Changed from `Image(systemName: "printer.fill")` with 56pt font
   - Changed to `Image("AppLogo")` with 56pt frame, rounded corners (12pt radius)
   - Removed `.foregroundStyle(Color.pfAccent)` since app logo has its own colors

2. **Onboarding Page 1 (`OnboardingView.swift`):**
   - Changed from `Image(systemName: "cube.fill")` with 72pt font
   - Changed to `Image("AppLogo")` with 72pt frame, rounded corners (16pt radius)
   - Pages 2 and 3 kept their feature-specific SF Symbols (`tray.full.fill`, `bell.badge.fill`)

3. **Launch Screen (`RootView.swift`):**
   - Changed from `Image(systemName: "printer.fill")` with 56pt font
   - Changed to `Image("AppLogo")` with 56pt frame, rounded corners (12pt radius)
   - Consistent branding during auth session restore

**Implementation:**
Created separate `AppLogo.imageset` because iOS `AppIcon` asset catalogs cannot be directly loaded in SwiftUI views via `Image("AppIcon")`. The AppLogo image set references the same 1024x1024 app icon PNG, making it accessible in-app.

**Image Modifiers:**
- `.resizable()` — allows scaling
- `.scaledToFit()` — maintains aspect ratio
- `.frame(width:height:)` — explicit sizing (56pt or 72pt depending on screen)
- `.clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius:))` — iOS-standard rounded app icon corners (12pt for small, 16pt for large)

**Key Pattern:**
For in-app use of the app icon, create a separate image set (e.g., `AppLogo.imageset`) that references the same PNG file as `AppIcon.appiconset`. This enables `Image("AppLogo")` to work in SwiftUI views while keeping the standard AppIcon for system use (home screen, app switcher, etc.).

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### PendingReady Visual Prominence and Sorting (2026-03-12)
**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Components/PrinterCardView.swift` (iPhone card)
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Components/iPadPrinterCardView.swift` (iPad card)
- `PrintFarmer/ViewModels/PrinterListViewModel.swift` (list sorting)
- `PrintFarmer/ViewModels/DashboardViewModel.swift` (dashboard sorting)
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Dashboard/DashboardView.swift` (active jobs sorting)

**Feature Added:**
Made printers in `pendingready` state visually obvious with bright yellow headers and sorted them to the top of all printer lists.

**Changes Made:**
1. **Header Color Change - PendingReady → Yellow:**
   - Changed `headerBaseColor` for `pendingready` state from brown `#b45309` to bright yellow `#eab308`
   - Applied to both iPhone and iPad printer card views
   - Matches the warning/attention color scheme — visually distinct from printing (blue), paused (brown), error (red), ready (green)

2. **Printer List Sorting:**
   - Added `sortPriority()` function to `PrinterListViewModel`
   - Priority order: PendingReady (0) → Printing (1) → Ready/Idle (2) → Everything else (3) → Offline (100)
   - Applied to `filteredPrinters` computed property via `.sorted { sortPriority($0) < sortPriority($1) }`
   - Ensures PendingReady printers always appear at the top of the list, demanding attention

3. **Dashboard Sorting:**
   - Added identical `sortPriority()` function to `DashboardViewModel` for `activePrintingPrinters`
   - Added `sortPriority()` function to `DashboardView` for local `activeJobsSection` filtering
   - Updated `activeJobsSection` filter to include `"pendingready"` alongside `"printing"` and `"paused"`
   - Ensures PendingReady printers show in "Active Jobs" section and sort to top

**Priority Logic:**
```swift
private func sortPriority(_ printer: Printer) -> Int {
    guard printer.isOnline else { return 100 }
    switch printer.state?.lowercased() {
    case "pendingready": return 0  // Top priority
    case "printing": return 1
    case "ready", "idle": return 2
    default: return 3
    }
}
```

**Color Reference:**
- PendingReady: `#eab308` (bright yellow — attention-grabbing)
- Printing: `#1d4ed8` (blue)
- Paused: `#b45309` (brown/amber)
- Error: `#dc2626` (red)
- Ready/Idle: `#059669` (green)
- Offline: `#4b5563` (gray)

**Key Decisions:**
- Used bright yellow (`#eab308`) instead of `.pfWarning` (`#d97706`) for higher contrast and visibility
- Sorted across all printer display contexts (PrinterListView, DashboardView active jobs) for consistency
- PendingReady printers now included in "Active Jobs" section since they need user action
- Offline printers always sorted last (priority 100) regardless of state

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### LaunchScreen Logo Fix (2025-07-25)
- Replaced the `UILabel` with 🌾 wheat emoji in `LaunchScreen.storyboard` with a `UIImageView` referencing the `AppLogo` asset from the catalog
- Added 56×56 explicit size constraints on the image view to match RootView.swift's SwiftUI launch screen
- Added `<image>` resource declaration and `Image references` capability to storyboard dependencies
- Kept existing LaunchBackground/LaunchText named colors and centered vertical stack layout
- Verified RootView.swift SwiftUI launch screen already uses `Image("AppLogo")` correctly — no changes needed there
- **Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

---

### Local Network Permission Step (2026-03-12)
**Files Created:**
- `PrintFarmer/Utilities/LocalNetworkAuthorization.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Auth/LocalNetworkPermissionView.swift`

**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/RootView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Info.plist`
- `PrintFarmer.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

**Bug Fixed:**
On first launch, signing in to a local-network PrintFarmer server would fail with "No internet connection. Check your network." because the iOS Local Network permission dialog raced with the login HTTP request.

**Root Cause:**
iOS shows the Local Network permission prompt lazily — only when the app first accesses the local network. The login request fires before the user responds to the dialog, causing URLSession to report `.notConnectedToInternet` which maps to `NetworkError.noConnection`.

**Solution:**
Added a new step in the first-launch flow (between onboarding and login) that proactively triggers the permission dialog:

1. **LocalNetworkAuthorization** — Uses `NWBrowser` with a `_printfarmer._tcp` Bonjour service type to trigger the system permission prompt. Wrapped in `async/await` with `withCheckedContinuation`. Swift 6 concurrency-safe (`@MainActor`, callbacks dispatched to main queue).

2. **LocalNetworkPermissionView** — Friendly screen with network icon, explanation text, and "Enable Network Access" button. After the system dialog is resolved, button changes to "Continue" to proceed to login.

3. **RootView flow update:** splash → onboarding → **network permission** → login. New `@AppStorage("hasCompletedNetworkPermission")` gate; only shown once.

4. **Info.plist** — Added `NSBonjourServices` array with `_printfarmer._tcp` (required for NWBrowser to trigger the permission dialog).

**Key Patterns:**
- NWBrowser Bonjour lookup to trigger local network permission (standard iOS pattern)
- `withCheckedContinuation` to bridge callback-based NWBrowser API to async/await
- `@AppStorage` boolean for one-time permission gate (same pattern as onboarding)
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: `DispatchQueue.main.async` wrapper for NWBrowser callbacks to satisfy `@MainActor` isolation

**Design Consistency:**
- 72pt SF Symbol icon (`network`) with `.pfAccent` color
- `.title .bold` headline, `.body .pfTextSecondary` description
- `.borderedProminent` button with `.pfAccent` tint, 32pt horizontal padding
- Matches onboarding page styling exactly

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### MJPEG Livestream for Active Printers (2026-07-24)
**Files Created:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Components/MJPEGStreamView.swift`

**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/ViewModels/PrinterDetailViewModel.swift`
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Printers/PrinterDetailView.swift`
- `PrintFarmer.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

**Feature Added:**
Implemented MJPEG livestream display when printers are actively printing, with automatic fallback to static snapshots.

**Implementation:**
1. **MJPEGStreamView (UIViewRepresentable):**
   - WKWebView wrapper that natively renders MJPEG streams from `cameraStreamUrl`
   - Supports camera rotation via CSS transforms
   - Disables scrolling/bouncing, transparent background for dark mode
   - `MJPEGStreamContainer` wrapper adds loading indicator with 2s auto-dismiss
   - `#if canImport(UIKit)` guard for platform compatibility

2. **PrinterDetailViewModel Changes:**
   - Added `showLivestream: Bool` toggle (default false, auto-enabled when printing)
   - Added `isActivelyPrinting` computed: true when state is "printing", "starting", or "paused"
   - Added `canShowLivestream` computed: `isActivelyPrinting && cameraStreamUrl != nil`
   - `applyLiveUpdate()` auto-toggles livestream on/off when state changes
   - `loadPrinter()` auto-enables livestream on initial load when printing

3. **PrinterDetailView Camera Section:**
   - LIVE/SNAPSHOT badge next to "Camera" header (red capsule for live, gray for snapshot)
   - Toggle button (video.fill ↔ photo icon) to switch between stream and snapshot
   - Refresh button hidden when in livestream mode (not needed for streams)
   - Rotation button always visible for both modes
   - Falls back to snapshot/placeholder when not printing or no stream URL

**Architecture Decisions:**
- WKWebView approach chosen over custom multipart HTTP parsing — Safari handles MJPEG natively
- Rotation applied via CSS in WebView (not SwiftUI `.rotationEffect`) to work within the web context
- Auto-toggle pattern: livestream turns on when printing starts (via SignalR), off when printing stops
- Manual override preserved: user can toggle back to snapshot even while printing

**Key Patterns:**
- `#if canImport(UIKit)` for platform-specific WebKit code
- `UIViewRepresentable` coordinator pattern for WKNavigationDelegate
- CSS injection via `evaluateJavaScript` for styling the MJPEG stream
- URL change detection in `updateUIView` via coordinator state

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### Always-Visible Filament Info on Printer Cards (2026-07-24)
**Files Modified:**
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Components/PrinterCardView.swift` (iPhone)
- `PrintFarmer/Views/Components/iPadPrinterCardView.swift` (iPad)

**Changes Made:**
1. **iPhone PrinterCardView — Added filament row:**
   - Added `filamentSection` computed property below temperature row
   - When `spoolInfo != nil && hasActiveSpool`: shows color circle, material, filament name, remaining weight (matching iPad layout)
   - When no spool: shows `Label("No spool loaded", systemImage: "cylinder")` in `.caption` / `.secondary`

2. **iPad iPadPrinterCardView — Always-visible filament:**
   - Removed conditional `if let spool = printer.spoolInfo, spool.hasActiveSpool` guard
   - Added else branch showing "No spool loaded" label with cylinder icon (matches PrinterDetailView pattern)

**No changes needed:**
- PendingReady yellow header: already implemented on both cards (`headerBaseColor` has `case "pendingready": return Color(hex: "#eab308")`)
- Sort order: already implemented in `PrinterListViewModel.sortPriority()` (pendingReady=0, printing=1, ready/idle=2, offline=100)
- PrinterDetailView: already handles both spool/no-spool states

**Key Patterns:**
- Filament empty state uses `Label` with `cylinder` SF Symbol, `.caption` font, `.secondary` foreground — consistent with PrinterDetailView
- `@ViewBuilder` used for `filamentSection` to support conditional content without `AnyView`
- iPhone filament row uses slightly smaller spacing (6pt) vs iPad (8pt) for compact layout

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

### Back Button Crash Fix + PendingReady Yellow Headers + Bed Clear Feedback (2026-03-14)
**Files Modified:**
- 13 View files across Views/Dashboard, Views/Printers, Views/Jobs, Views/Filament, Views/Maintenance, Views/Notifications
- 5 ViewModel files: DispatchViewModel, PrinterDetailViewModel, JobDetailViewModel, JobHistoryViewModel, AutoDispatchViewModel
- 2 Card components: PrinterCardView, iPadPrinterCardView
- PrinterListViewModel (sort priority fix)

**Bug Fixed (Task 1): Back button crashes on all pushed views**
Root cause: Unstructured `Task { }` blocks in Button actions survived view dismissal. When views are popped from NavigationStack, these tasks mutate `@Observable` ViewModels for deallocated views → crash.

Fix applied consistently across ALL views:
1. **Fix 1 (Store & Cancel):** Added `@State private var activeTasks: [Task<Void, Never>] = []` (or named task refs for simpler views). All `Task { }` in button actions now store task refs. `.onDisappear` cancels all tasks.
2. **Fix 2 (isActive guard):** Added `var isViewActive = true` to ViewModels of pushed views. Async load methods guard on `isViewActive`. `.onDisappear` sets `viewModel.isViewActive = false`.

**Bug Fixed (Task 2): Bed Clear button no immediate feedback**
In AutoDispatchSection, the "Confirm Bed Clear" button now includes `viewModel.isMarkingReady` in its disabled condition, preventing double-taps. The existing ProgressView spinner was already wired to `isMarkingReady`; the disabled state now also gates on it.

**Bug Fixed (Task 3): PendingReady printers not showing yellow headers**
Root cause: `headerBaseColor` checked `!printer.isOnline` BEFORE checking state. When the API returns `isOnline: false` for PendingReady printers, the card showed gray instead of yellow.

Fix: In both PrinterCardView and iPadPrinterCardView, pendingReady state is now checked FIRST, before the isOnline check. Same fix applied to:
- `statusLabel` — "Bed Clear" shown regardless of isOnline
- `statusAccentColor` — `.pfWarning` returned for pendingReady regardless of isOnline
- `sortPriority` in PrinterListViewModel and DashboardView — pendingReady sorts to top regardless of isOnline

Added debug logging (`print("DEBUG headerBaseColor: ...")`) to both card views to help diagnose if issues persist.

**Key Pattern (Task Lifecycle):**
- Pushed views: `activeTasks` array + `.onDisappear { activeTasks.forEach { $0.cancel() }; viewModel.isViewActive = false }`
- Root tab views: Named `retryTask` ref (less crash-prone but still good practice)
- ViewModels: `guard isViewActive else { return }` at top of async load methods

**Build Result:** ✅ Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator

## 2026-03-14 — Back-Button Crashes & Notification Fixes (Lambert cross-pollination)

**Related fixes from Lambert:**
- Notification deduplication now uses printer UUID identifiers instead of random UUIDs
- This ensures proper cleanup when printers leave PendingReady state
- Impact: Filament indicator cards with yellow "pending" headers benefit from cleaner notification lifecycle
